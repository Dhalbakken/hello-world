Greetings. I am currently preparing to experiment with C#, C++, and a few different game engines.
Between my Windows 10 machine and my mac, I will be using the following:
Epic Games Unreal Engine 4.10.4
Epic Games Unreal Engine 4.11
Unity 5
Visual Studio Community 2015
Visual Studio Code
Xcode
My intention is to establish a foundation with these programming languages in preparation for my upcoming programming and scripting courses in the fall.

In the future, I may delve into the world of Game Design, but I have a long way to go before then.
Until then, the world of code shall be my sandbox.
